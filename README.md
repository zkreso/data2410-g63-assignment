# Group Portfolio assignment DATA2410

This repository contains the Docker build and compose file(s) required to launch our implementation of the Docker and Zabbix use-case as outlined by the assignment.

This implementation requires the open source Sysbox runtime for Docker. It is available here on Github: [Sysbox](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox). The Sysbox runtime is only available for Linux (WSL is not supported).
